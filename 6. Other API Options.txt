OTHER API OPTIONS
*****************

* Static Files Serving
----------------------

With an express-based server it is possible to serve static files (images, etc).

1) The only that you need to do, to serve static files, is going to index.js and add these lines of code:

	//Serving static files
	app.use(express.static('public'));

2) To test that is working, the only you need to do is to open a browser, adding the localhost and the name of the static file:
	
	localhost:3000/football.jpeg

Now, any files that are in the declared static folder will be available to any front end that needs it.


* Other potential libraries for API
-----------------------------------

- KOAJ: Next generation Web Framework for Node.js
	Uses generators instead of callbacks.
	They also remove Middlewares to make the library smaller.

- SWAGGER / LOOPBACK: Provide full-fledge pre-built APIS.  This are API generators where you can easily build a backend server with all your API endpoints with a few 
	CLI commands.
