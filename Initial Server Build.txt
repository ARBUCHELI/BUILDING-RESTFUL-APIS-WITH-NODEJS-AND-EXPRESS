* RESTful APIs refresher
------------------------

- RESTful API: With to transact with a Backend, using HTTP transactions.
	We use a series of calls:
		- GET
		- POST
		- PUT
		- DELETE

	with a html address to transact with our backend and its data, So when a Frontend needs to make transactions with a Backend, it makes a call.
	For example GET with a html endpoint that looks like an URL, and the API responds with success or failure with data if need be. 

		- GET: Pulls (Gets) the data from the backend.
		- POST: Adds new data.
		- PUT: Updates the data.
		- DELETE: Deletes the data.
